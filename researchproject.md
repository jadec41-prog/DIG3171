# My Final Research Project  

This is a big project, and you definitely want a place to show it off! Here's a suggested layout for that (but feel free to display your work however you prefer).
You can link to your project here, or embed it.
If it is easier to embed your project in an HTML file, just change the .md on this one to .html, and write in HTML! (Be sure to update the links to this page to reflect the new name though!)

# Abstract

This project utilized Bitsy, a minimal pixel-art game engine, to craft an interactive digital space that prompts players to consider their emotional connection to nature. It emphasizes humanity’s increasing disconnection from natural environments and shows the healing and empathetic influence of ecological awareness. Although the visuals seem simple, the project uses interactive storytelling to highlight the mental and emotional benefits of engaging with nature, even through symbolic or virtual forms. 

Environmental psychologists emphasize that emotional connection to nature strongly correlates with well-being and prosocial behavior (Mayer and Frantz). Research shows that even indirect or mediated exposure to natural environments can reduce stress and improve attention (Kaplan; Berto). Studies in game-based persuasion suggest that interactive systems influence values through procedural meaning rather than realism (Bogost). Game-studies scholars similarly argue that virtual ecological spaces can foster environmental empathy and ethical reflection (Chang). Together, these views show that simple digital tools can serve as powerful spaces for healing, memory, and ecological imagination, reminding us that even pixelated leaves can evoke emotional roots.
