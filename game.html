  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p> You step into the forest, leaving behind the noise of campus life. The path is quiet, the air cool, and your thoughts begin to slow. As you walk, you notice how the branches sway lightly in the wind and how the sound of the stream pulls your attention without effort. The forest doesn’t demand focus, it restores it. Each step feels like a release, as if the weight of your anxiety is absorbed into the earth. 

At a clearing, you pause and breathe deeply, your heartbeat steadying. This is mindfulness in its simplest form: paying attention to the present without judgment. You realize that here, in this space of soft fascination, your mind is no longer racing with deadlines and worries. The forest welcomes you with acceptance, reminding you that even brief moments in nature can quiet the storm inside. </p>
